# Relational Database : 

A relational database is a (most commonly digital) database based on the relational model of data,
as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.

A system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system (RDBMS).

Many relational database systems are equipped with the option of using the SQL (Structured Query Language) 
for querying and maintaining the database.





ERD Cardinality :
Cardinality is the maximum times an entity can relate to an instance with another entity or entity set.
Ordinality is the minimum time an entity can relate to an instance with another entity or entity set. Usually,
in ER diagrams, these terms are used under cardinality itself.
The cardinality constraints are within the maximum and minimum numbers that are relevant to a relationship.
Cardinality is represented by lines that have different stylings depending on the type of cardinality that is to be shown.


Product table >>  product category 
 one product        one category    : one to one 


 many product       one category    : many to one 

 students            teachers       : many to many
 students            subjects       : many to many








SQL :
SQL "sequel" - Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed 
for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS),
or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).






SQL data types :
predefined data types
constructed types
user-defined types.

Character types
      Character (CHAR)
      Character varying (VARCHAR)
      Character large object (CLOB)
  National character types
      National character (NCHAR)
      National character varying (NCHAR VARYING)
      National character large object (NCLOB)
  Binary types
      Binary (BINARY)
      Binary varying (VARBINARY)
      Binary large object (BLOB)
  Numeric types
      Exact numeric types (NUMERIC, DECIMAL, SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT)
      Approximate numeric types (FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION)
      Decimal floating-point type (DECFLOAT)
  Datetime types (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP)
  Interval type (INTERVAL)
  Boolean
  XML
  JSON

    CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
    ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
